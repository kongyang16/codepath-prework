## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## App Brainstorming

### Favorite Applications
1. **Instagram**
   - Easy-to-use story editor with filters, stickers and text
   - Dark‑mode toggle for comfortable browsing at night

2. **Spotify**
   - Personalized daily and weekly playlists generated by ML
   - Offline downloads so you can listen without an internet connection

3. **Duolingo**
   - Gamified, bite‑sized lessons with streak‑tracking and rewards
   - Push‑notification reminders to keep your learning streak alive

4. **Todoist**
   - Quick task entry via natural‑language parsing (e.g. “Call Bob tomorrow at 3pm”)
   - Cross‑device sync and priority tags to keep you organized everywhere

### App Idea: StudyAssist
I’d like to build an iOS app called **StudyAssist** that helps students coordinate and run group study sessions end‑to‑end.  
- **Event Scheduler & Invites**: Create one‑off or recurring study events, invite peers, and automatically sync to your calendar.  
- **Collaborative Flashcards**: Build shared decks in real time—anyone can add, edit or quiz each other.  
- **Live Chat & Snippet Sharing**: In‑app messaging with Markdown support for sharing notes, links or code snippets.  
- **Built‑in Pomodoro Timer**: Start timed focus sessions together and track collective progress.

This makes it easy to plan, prep and actually power through study sessions—all without juggling five different apps.


## Notes
